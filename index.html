                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>In the 21st century, the interplay between digital media and freedom of speech has emerged as a defining feature of modern democracies. The digital transformation has revolutionized information access and dissemination while shaping the exercise of the fundamental human right of freedom of expression. This article delves into the intricate relationship between digital media and freedom of speech, highlighting the pivotal role of digital platforms in fostering inclusivity, amplifying diverse voices, and challenging established power structures.</p>
                <p>In the digital age, digital media serves as both a beacon of hope for freedom of speech and a potential source of challenges. It possesses the potential to democratize public discourse, amplify underrepresented voices, and disrupt entrenched power dynamics. However, responsible stewardship and effective regulation are essential to address the negative consequences of unbridled expression. As societies grapple with the complexities of this interplay, striking the right balance between openness and responsibility remains crucial for safeguarding the foundations of democracy.</p>
                <p>This study's core objective is to investigate how digital media, including social networking platforms, online news outlets, and user-generated content, has transformed the exercise of freedom of speech. Additionally, the study will explore how digital media platforms facilitate the amplification of diverse voices and perspectives, shedding light on the transformative power of these platforms in shaping the contemporary landscape of free expression.</p>
